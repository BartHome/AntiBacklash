Tool for backlash compensation of Z axis on FDM 3d printers

This tool was created to post-process the .g file generated by the slicer.
The Z values are raised by the amount that the user specifies in the nummeric up/down box (starting at the second layer).

This solves the problem for my flashforge adventurer 3.
When the printhead is brought all the way down to start printing the first layer, the backlash will remain on the "high" position.
When the second layer gets printed, the head will not raise because of the backlash (0.4 mm in my case), leading to a squached second layer and a pileup of fillament that will ruin the following layers as well.

Warning: This tool should only be used when the z axis will keep going up the entire print (in most normal cases).
It will only take away the backlash on the transtion between first and second layer (so no z-hops on retraction etc. should be used).

Disclaimer: I have used this succesfully for the last 30+ prints, but since there are many differences in setup/slicer/G-code it will not be guaranteed to work every time.
It is advisable to diff the input/output with a compare tool (notepad++ plugin will do), especially when you use this tool for the first time.
